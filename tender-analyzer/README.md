# Tender Analyzer

Prototype for ingesting tender documents and producing simple highlight / detail summaries plus evaluations. The backend is a FastAPI app that keeps tender state in memory, answers static questions, and exposes endpoints for the React frontend. The frontend is a Vite + React dashboard that uploads files, polls for step completion, and renders the placeholder answers.

## Running locally

1. **Backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   poetry install         # or pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart pydantic
   poetry run uvicorn tender_analyzer.apps.api_gateway.main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend/web
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

Once both services run you can upload a package, start the analysis, and see the highlight, detail, and evaluation results generated by the placeholder QA service.

## Optional vector store

If you already have a Qdrant instance you can point the backend at it via environment variables (`QDRANT_URL`, `QDRANT_API_KEY`, etc.). Chunks produced by the `coarse_to_fine` parser are hashed into fixed-size vectors before being pushed into a per-tender collection, which prepares the project for future similarity search and citation features.
