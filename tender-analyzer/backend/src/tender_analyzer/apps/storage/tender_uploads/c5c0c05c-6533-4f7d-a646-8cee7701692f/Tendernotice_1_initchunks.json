The States have done a review of the status of\ntheir dams and have determined those dams that are most in need of\nrehabilitation and improvement in order to guarantee their future\nsafety and operational capacity. It was agreed that the States have an\noption to substitute a few of the currently selected dams with other\ndams, if it is found that these dams have higher needs. The proposed\ninterventions will include, but not be limited to, such works as:\ntreatment for reduction of seepage through masonry and concrete\ndams and reduction of seepage through earth dams; improving dam\ndrainage; treatment for cracking in the dam, improving the ability to\nwithstand higher floods, including additional flood handling facilities,\nas required by the hydrological assessments, accompanied by\nstructural strengthening of dams; non-structural measures to cater for\nhigher design floods in case structural measures are physically not\nfeasible; rehabilitation and improvement of spillways, head regulators,\ndraw-off gates and their operating mechanisms, stilling basins, and\ndownstream spillway channels; improving approach roads; improving\noffice and housing accommodation; and improving dam safety\ninstrumentation.
