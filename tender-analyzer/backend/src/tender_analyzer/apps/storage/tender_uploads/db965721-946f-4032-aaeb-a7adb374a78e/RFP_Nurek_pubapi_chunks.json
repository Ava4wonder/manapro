Terms of Reference FOR PROVISION OF CONSULTING SERVICES TO BARQI TOJIK FOR TECHNICAL SUPPORT & CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISION CONSULTANCY I.\nINTRODUCTION 1.\nThe objective of the Consultancy Services is to provide design, technical support and\nconstruction supervision of the Nurek Hydropower Rehabilitation Project to restore the\ngeneration capacity of the plant and the operational safety of the dam.\n\n2.\nThe Nurek Hydropower Plant (HPP) is the backbone of the Tajik power system and\ngenerates 70 percent of the electricity consumed in the country. The dam is a 300 meters high\nembankment dam on the Vakhsh River located 80 km (by road) from Dushanbe. The plant,\nwhich was constructed in the 1970s has nine Francis turbines with an installed capacity of 3,000\nMW. It is the only hydropower plant with a reservoir in Tajikistan. After four decades of\noperations, the Nurek HPP now requires major rehabilitation of its generating units and a series\nof works to ensure its continued safe operation. Increasing the available capacity of the Nurek\nHPP is key to achieving energy security in the country.\n\n3.\nThe executing agency for the Project is Barqi Tojik (BT), a vertically integrated stateowned enterprise, which is the major service provider in the power sector covering all functions\nfrom generation and transmission to distribution and supply. Annex 1 provides further details on\nthe power sector and facilities.\n\n4.\nIn 2014, Barqi Tojik, with the financial assistance of the World Bank, launched the\n“Techno-Economic Assessment Study for Nurek HPP Rehabilitation and Dam Safety\nProvisions” (Feasibility Study), which has been carried out by Tractebel Engineering of France.\nIn parallel, also under World Bank funding, HR Wallingford carried out Nurek Reservoir\nSedimentation Study under a contract with Barqi Tojik. Both studies were completed in February\n20168. Barqi Tojik will provide copies of the full reports of these studies to the participating\nbidders for information. II.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT 5.\nIt is anticipated that the rehabilitation of the Nurek HPP will be carried out in two\n\n8 Additional follow-up studies, such as advanced flood forecasting system, seismic hazard assessment and dynamic analysis,\ninvestigation of the left bank geological feature and spillway tunnels condition, etc. are being carried out by Tractebel\nEngineering. Barqi Tojik will provide details of these studies to the participating bidders for information. Barqi Tojik will review\nthe results of these studies with the selected bidder as soon as the studies are completed, which is expected during the last quarter\nof 2016.",

      "text": "Request for Proposals — 47 | P a g e — Annex 1\nBackground on Nurek hydropower plant\n Commissioned in 1970s, Nurek dam is the largest and most important dam in the Vakhsh River. It comprises a 300 meter-high embankment dam with impervious core,\ntwo spillway tunnels in the left bank designed for an evacuation capacity of 5,400\nm3/s and a power plant of nice Francis units for a total capacity of 3000 MW.\n While Nurek's primary purpose is power generation, the reservoir also supplies irrigation water for about 70,000 ha of agriculture land via a tunnel from the\nreservoir.\n No capital rehabilitation has been undertaken since the HPP started operating. Unit 8 has been out of operation since 2011 and the maximum capacity of the plant has\ndeclined to 2,320 MW. With the financial support from ADB and KfW, the 220 kV\nand 500 kV switchyards have been recently reconstructed.\n The construction of the power plant was carried out from 1961 to 1979. The initial installed capacity of the power plant was 2700 MW, which was increased to 3,000\nMW in 1988 through an upgrade of hydraulic turbines. The units are now facing\nproblems of vibrations and / or temperature alarms which require the capacity of\nsome of the units to be reduced. In particular, Unit 8 has been out of operation since\n2011 for refurbishment of runner, MIV and transformer. In recent years, the\nmaximum capacity of the plant has not exceeded 2,320 MW.\n Annually 60-115 million cubic meters of water is reduced due to sedimentation accumulation, which reduces available storage capacity, and subsequently winter\nenergy generation by the Nurek HPP and the other HPPs. The other HPPs are run-ofriver plants located downstream of the Nurek HPP.",
