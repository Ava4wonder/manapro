      "text": "A&Q Hydro Power Project – Consultant Tender — 2 Description — For a new hydropower station to supply Qasigiannguit and Aasiaat, the following is proposed ![Figure]() ![Figure]() The hydroelectric power plant utilizes the water resources from the Kuussuup Tasia\ncatchment area and supplies Aasiaat and Qasigiannguit with energy for electricity and\nheating. The facility uses Qinngap Ilulialeeraa (Lake 3) as the upper reservoir and Kuussuup Tasia (Lake\n2) as the lower reservoir and intake basin. A regulated transfer tunnel will be constructed\nbetween the two lakes. No dam will be built. The inlet tunnel leads to an underground power station located near the fjord to the north. The\nwater is discharged into the fjord through a short tunnel. The power plant also includes an\nabove-ground portal building, from which the access tunnel leads to the power station. The power station is expected to be equipped with three Francis turbines; each rated at 7.0\nMW. All structures must be designed and dimensioned with consideration for the presence of\ncontinuous permafrost in the area. From the power station, one transmission line will run to a transformer station in\nQasigiannguit and another line to a transformer station in Aasiaat. When constructing the",

The hydropower plant is situated at the Kangersuneq fjord. General Structure of the Facility The hydropower facility utilizes the catchment area around Lake 2 and Lake 3. In addition to\nprecipitation, Lake 3 also receives runoƯ from a glacier, and its outﬂow goes to Lake 2. Both lakes are used as reservoirs (see Appendix 3). Lake 3 is the main reservoir, with storage\ncapacity created by lowering the lake level by 32 m from its natural surface elevation at +182\nm. The reservoir is drawn down in proportion to consumption and supplies Lake 2 through a\ntransfer tunnel with a controllable valve. The secondary reservoir is created in Lake 2 by lowering the lake level by 8 m from its natural\nsurface elevation at +143 m. From the intake at Lake 2, water is conveyed through a tunnel to\nthe underground power station near the fjord. ![Figure]() ![Figure]() ![Figure]()",
