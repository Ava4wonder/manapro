Role: Owner’s Engineer / Implementation Consultant**\nThe document explicitly refers to the entity as the **\"Implementation Consultant (IC)\"**, which is a standard term used in development finance (e.g., by the Asian Development Bank - ADB) for an independent consultant hired by the **project owner or implementing agency (PMU)** to:\n- Assess project feasibility and condition,\n- Prepare technical and procurement documents,\n- Support tendering and contractor selection,\n- Monitor implementation,\n- Ensure compliance with donor (ADB) standards and grant agreements,\n- Report to the owner and donor.\n\nThis is **not** an EPC (Engineering, Procurement, Construction) designer, nor is it a lender’s engineer.\n\n---\n\n### ❌ **Not EPC Designer**\n- The IC is **not responsible for designing the project as a contractor**.\n- The IC **prepares design criteria and scope**, but **does not execute the construction**.\n- The actual design and construction will be done by **bidders (EPC contractors)** selected through a competitive process.\n- The IC **reviews** the EPC designs but does **not produce them**.\n\n> Example: “The IC will carry out a detailed assessment of the condition of the switchyards and will submit a Design Report...” — this is advisory, not execution.\n\n---\n\n### ❌ **Not Lender’s Engineer**\n- While the IC reports to ADB (the lender), it is **not acting as the lender’s representative** in a financial or risk-monitoring capacity.\n- The IC’s role is **technical and project implementation-focused**, not financial due diligence or loan servicing.\n- Lender’s engineers typically focus on **financial risk, disbursement controls, and loan compliance**, whereas this IC is focused on **technical quality, design, procurement, and construction oversight**.\n\n> Example: The IC prepares reports for ADB, but its primary client is the **PMU (Project Management Unit)**, which is the project owner.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Key Indicators of Owner’s Engineer Role:**\n\n| Feature | Evidence from Context |\n|-------|------------------------|\n| **Independent oversight** | The IC is not part of the construction team; it advises the PMU and ADB. |\n| **Design & procurement support** | Prepares bid documents, evaluates bids, assists in contractor selection. |\n| **Monitoring & reporting** | Monthly/quarterly progress reports, safety, quality, environmental monitoring. |\n| **Technical review** | Reviews contractor designs (e.g., C&P, SCADA, gates), ensures compliance. |\n| **Client: PMU (project owner)** | The IC works for PMU, not the contractor or lender. |\n| **ADB compliance** | Reports to ADB, follows ADB procurement and monitoring frameworks. |\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Conclusion:**\n> The requested role is that of an **Owner’s Engineer (or Implementation Consultant)** — an independent technical advisor hired by the **project owner (PMU)** to ensure the **technical quality, compliance, and successful delivery** of the rehabilitation project, particularly under **ADB funding and oversight**.\n\nThis role is **not** EPC design, nor is it a lender’s engineer — it is a **project implementation and quality assurance function** on behalf of the **owner**.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n> **Role Requested:** **Owner’s Engineer (Implementation Consultant)**  \n> **Client:** Project Management Unit (PMU)  \n> **Donor Oversight:** Asian Development Bank (ADB)  \n> **Key Responsibilities:** Technical assessment, design preparation, procurement support, contractor evaluation, construction monitoring, reporting, compliance with ADB standards.", "ProjectType": "Rehabilitation", "Project Scope": "Phase: Construction supervision and contract administration  \nScope: Implementation of two contracts — Powerhouse rehabilitation and Switchyard rehabilitation — including design review, bid preparation, contractor selection assistance, construction supervision, quality and schedule control, safety coordination, environmental monitoring, and project reporting.", "location": "Asia, Tajikistan, Vaksh River, Dushanbe", "deadline": "N/A", "submission_format": "Both electronic and hard copy", "budgetRange": "N/A", "bid bond": "N/A", "evaluationMethod": "Mixed", "weighting": "N/A"}}
