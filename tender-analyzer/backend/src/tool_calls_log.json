Greenland or the Arctic are not mentioned. |\n| 0b6b04aa‑bae7‑4478‑b39b‑d3a2c8036e1a | **No** | The brochure enumerates pumped‑storage projects worldwide (e.g., Grand Paradiso, Lago Bianco, Enguri, etc.) but contains no reference to Greenland or the Arctic region. |\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNone of the provided documents contain evidence that Gruner has undertaken consultancy for construction or civil‑engineering work on hydro‑electric power plants in Greenland or the Arctic region within the last 10 years. Therefore, no candidate/entry meets the specified criteria."
