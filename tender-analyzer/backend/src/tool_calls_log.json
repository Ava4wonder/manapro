    "rag_answer": "**1. Identified Candidate:**  \nThe entry titled *\"JUMPING DAMS – PARAMETRIC DESIGN TOOL FOR DAMS / CONCEPT FOR THE PLANNING OF THE PRE-FEASIBILITY OF DAMS AND HYDROPOWER PLANTS\"* (from the file `2025_EN_GRUSTY_ presentation PSP.pdf`) meets the criteria.  \n\n**2. Explanation:**  \n- **Meets the criteria explicitly:** The title directly references a **parametric design tool** for dams and a **planning concept** for pre-feasibility studies of dams and hydropower plants.  \n- **Supporting details from context:**  \n  - The entry mentions \"parametric design tool for dams,\" aligning with the requirement for innovative design methodologies.  \n  - It specifies the tool's purpose as \"planning of the pre-feasibility of dams and hydropower plants,\" which matches the focus on early-stage project planning.  \n  - The inclusion of three images (`[images:3]`) suggests visual or technical documentation of the tool/concept, further validating its relevance.  \n\n**3. Excluded Entries:**  \nOther entries (e.g., those discussing general engineering services, specific dam projects like Karun IV or Deriner, or company overviews) do not explicitly mention parametric design tools or pre-feasibility planning concepts. They focus on completed projects, client information, or broad competencies, which do not meet the specific criteria outlined in the query."

Explanation of Criteria Met:**  \n- **Entry 1** explicitly states Gruner’s involvement in **Pumped Storage Projects (PSP)** in the Philippines, including specific projects like *Alimit PSP (250 MW)* and *Wawa PSP (600 MW)*. It also highlights their expertise in hydropower engineering and feasibility studies, directly aligning with the requirement for PSP-related work.  \n- **Entry 2** mentions Gruner’s core services in **Pumped Storage Projects (PSP)** under their hydropower and dam engineering offerings. While it focuses on dam heightening (e.g., *Nurek Dam in Tajikistan*), the explicit inclusion of PSP in their service portfolio meets the criteria.  \n\n**3. Contextual Justification:**  \n- Both entries directly reference **Pumped Storage Projects (PSP)** in their content, as required.  \n- Entry 1 provides concrete examples of PSP projects in the Philippines, while Entry 2 ties PSP to Gruner’s broader hydropower expertise.  \n- The third entry (from `2025_EN_DamHeightening_SCREEN.pdf`) is excluded because it focuses solely on dam heightening and rehabilitation without mentioning PSP.  \n\n**Only information from the provided context is used.**"

It provides specific examples (e.g., Cleuson-Dixence hydropower plant) and technical details (e.g., hydraulic head up to 1,800 m). This directly aligns with requirements for hydraulic engineering expertise.  \n   - **Entry 3** (third entry) focuses on **hydraulic transient computations** and expert support for complex projects like water transfer schemes and pumping stations. Its title and content emphasize advanced hydraulic analysis, which meets the criteria for specialized engineering solutions.  \n\n3. **Relevance to Requirements**:  \n   - Both entries highlight **hydraulic engineering expertise** (penstocks, pressure shafts, transient computations) and **project-specific examples**, fulfilling the need for technical depth and real-world application.  \n   - Entry 1’s focus on **steel-lined structures** and high-flow-rate projects (up to 320 m³/s) demonstrates advanced capability, while Entry 3’s emphasis on **long-distance water transfer** and pumping stations addresses large-scale infrastructure needs.  \n\n*(Note: The third entry in the list is the one with the title \"HYDRAULIC STEEL STRUCTURES AND PENSTOCK ENGINEERING\" and ID `130ab2e2-86a0-4d97-8e3b-79dd4a65928d`—it is the most specific to hydraulic engineering.)*"

    "rag_answer": "**Answer:**  \nThe candidates/entries that meet the criteria are **Wawa (Philippines)**, **Djerdap III (Serbia)**, **Pakil (Philippines)**, and **Nant de Drance (Switzerland)**.  \n\n**Explanation:**  \n1. **Wawa (Philippines)**:  \n   - Meets the criteria by being explicitly listed in both the \"2025_EN_Pumped storage_PRINT.pdf\" (capacity: 600 MW, head: 463 m, discharge: 194 m³/s) and the \"2025_EN_GRUSTY_General presentation.pdf\" (capacity: 600 MW, head: 463 m, discharge: 194 m³/s). It is operational (2023–2024) and uses variable speed units (VSU).  \n\n2. **Djerdap III (Serbia)**:  \n   - Meets the criteria by being detailed in both documents (capacity: 2400 MW, head: ~400 m, discharge: ~500 m³/s). It is under development (2023–ongoing) and includes variable speed units (VSU).  \n\n3. **Pakil (Philippines)**:  \n   - Meets the criteria by being listed in both sources (capacity: 1400 MW, head: 430 m, discharge: 350 m³/s). It is under development (2023–ongoing) and uses variable speed units (VSU).  \n\n4. **Nant de Drance (Switzerland)**:  \n   - Meets the criteria by being explicitly mentioned in both documents (capacity: 900 MW, head: 300 m, discharge: 250 m³/s). It is operational (2009–2020) and uses variable speed units (VSU).  \n\nAll four projects are highlighted in the provided context as examples of pumped storage projects with technical specifications and operational statuses, fulfilling the requirement to use only the information from the given sources."
